# route-curvature

A small and flexible tool written in C to calculate the curvature of a route.

Takes space separated data file as input, but also includes python script to convert GPX in a readable format.
Output is a space separated data file as well, ready to be plotted by gnuplot or similar software.

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bluntphenomena/route-curvature.git
$ cd route-curvature
$ make
```

## Usage

```
route-curvature [options] -i file

Options:
-h, --help          prints this help message and exit
-s, --smoothness    number of points to calculate curvature from.
                    The more points, the smoother the output gets.
                    (Default value: 5)
-t                  treat input values as cartesic coordinates instead of
                    using mercator projection on geographic coordinates
-i, --input         input file
-o, --output        output file
```

### Example

```
$ ./route-curvature -s10 -i examples/maglev.dat -o examples/maglev_out.dat
$ gnuplot
gnuplot> plot "examples/maglev_out.dat" using 1:2 with lines
```

## How it works

Let _d_ be the distance between the first and last point of a route segment consisting of _n_ points.

![how1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluntphenomena/route-curvature/master/documentation/route1.png)

Find a circle with radius _r_ that goes best through the points of the route segment.
The smallest possible radius is half of the distance between the first and last point.

![how2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluntphenomena/route-curvature/master/documentation/route4.png)

The largest value for the radius is infinite, that is a straight line.

![how3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluntphenomena/route-curvature/master/documentation/route3.png)

So _r_ is in range [_d_/2, âˆž].
And because the curvature _c_ = 1/_r_, the possible values for _c_ are [0, 2/_d_]

A model graph of how the deviation between the route segment and the circle with radius _r_=1/_c_ relates on the curvature value.
